There is a wide variety of the amount of schools present in each zip code in the District of Columbia. The public schools in the district are spread out differently in each zip code. This creates a large question of why. The zip code with the most number of schools is 20002 with 15 public schools. While three zip codes, 20005, 20015, and 20036, tie for only one public school. The distribution of these percentages can be seen in the chart labeled “Percentage of DCPS per Zip Code.” 
The disparities of school in the different zip codes are not the only questionable thing. There is also a large number of elementary schools compared to the other schools. This also raises the question of where do the students go after elementary school. Around 56.7% of the students in the D.C. Public Schools attend elementary schools. 

If there are more than 50% of students in public schools, do these students then move to private education, or something else? This then leads to asking an expert on the matter or someone within the DCPS to answer where these students are going. If the students are leaving to go to private schools, why? Asking possible families what made them decide to move from the public schools to go private would allow for understanding of the large loss in students. If the private schools are providing more opportunities, then what are those opportunities, if any. If the private schools are higher in education, what are test scores and graduation statistics? Finding out these data points, but also the opinions of the families, could explain why there is such a deficit in the number of students in the highschools compared to the elementary schools. Gathering both opinions and data are beneficial in these explanations to the unusual curves in the data.
