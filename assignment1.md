# Pre-Class Survery Analysis #
Something interesting in the spreedsheet to take note of is how all but one person is interested in written articles form of journalism media. This showed that the class is largely interested in writing with other forms, while only one person is only interested in video and graphics.

I also noticed that about 60% of people said they would rather confront 100 duck-sized horses instead of 1 horse-sized duck. It interesting to see that there is not just one answer that largerly prevails. While 60% is large, it is not more than 75%. This is closer to a 50:50 ratio more than anything else.

I think it is interesting to see the data between a group that has similar interests but very different ways in which they may identify or agree with.
