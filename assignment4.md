Dear Mayor Muriel Bowser,

Pursuant to the state open records law D.C. Code Ann. Secs. 2-531 to 2-540, I write to request access to and a copy of all of the salaries of the D.C. city police in the year of 2025. If your agency does not maintain these public records, please let me know who does and include the proper custodian's name and address.

I agree to pay any reasonable copying and postage fees of not more than $50. If the cost would be greater than this amount, please notify me. Please provide a receipt indicating the charges for each document.

As provided by the Freedom of Information Act, I would request your response within fifteen (15) business days. See D.C. Code Sec. 2-532(c1). If you are requesting police body camera footage, I would request your response within twenty-five (25) days. See D.C. Code Sec. 2-532(c2).

If you choose to deny this request, please provide a written explanation for the denial including a reference to the specific statutory exemption(s) upon which you rely. Also, please provide all segregable portions of otherwise exempt material.

I would note that willful violation of the open records law can result in the award of reasonable attorney fees and other costs of litigation. See D.C. Code Sec. 2-537(c). Anyone who commits an arbitrary or capricious violation of the Freedom of Information Act can be charged with a misdemeanor and fined up to $100. See D.C. Code Sec. 2-537(d).

Thank you for your assistance.

Sincerely,

Anastasia Menchyk
