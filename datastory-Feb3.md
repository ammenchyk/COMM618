# Boys are behind in reading in every age # 

The first set of data that is presented is the reading scores for both boys and girls in 12th grade across nearly 20 years. This data shows a wide range of a sample size that can back the hypothesis that boys have a lower reading level than girls. This first data set is presented well. I think the chart that is used shows the data in a simple, clear way that almost anyone can understand without any other context.
I think something different that could have been done is adding more age groups, both younger and older. While I think this sample does show a wide variety, this could change with each age.
